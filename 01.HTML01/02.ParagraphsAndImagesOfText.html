<p>A web browser can read <b>HTML</b> files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. <u>The browser does not display the <b>HTML</b> tags</u>, but uses them to interpret the content of the page.<br><b> HTML</b>describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a programming language.

    <b>HTML</b> elements form the building blocks of all websites. <b>HTML</b> allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as <b>JavaScript</b> which affect the behavior of <b>HTML</b> web pages.

    <pre>Web browsers can also refer to </pre> Cascading Style Sheets <b>(CSS)</b> to define the look and layout of text and other material. The <b>W3C</b>, maintainer of both the <b>HTML</b>> and the <b>CSS</b> standards, encourages the use of <b>CSS</b> over explicit presentational <b>HTML</b>.[1]</div>
